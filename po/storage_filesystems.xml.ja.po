"The code for Ext2 is the strong foundation on which Ext3 could become a "
"highly acclaimed next-generation file system. Its reliability and solidity "
"are elegantly combined in Ext3 with the advantages of a journaling file "
"system. Unlike transitions to other journaling file systems, such as XFS, "
"which can be quite tedious (making backups of the entire file system and re-"
"creating it from scratch), a transition to Ext3 is a matter of minutes. It "
"is also very safe, because re-creating an entire file system from scratch "
"might not work flawlessly. Considering the number of existing Ext2 systems "
"that await an upgrade to a journaling file system, you can easily see why "
"Ext3 might be of some importance to many system administrators. Downgrading "
"from Ext3 to Ext2 is as easy as the upgrade. Perform a clean unmount of the "
"Ext3 file system and remount it as an Ext2 file system."

"Some other journaling file systems follow the <quote>metadata-only</quote> "
"journaling approach. This means your metadata is always kept in a consistent "
"state, but this cannot be automatically guaranteed for the file system data "
"itself. Ext3 is designed to take care of both metadata and data. The degree "
"of <quote>care</quote> can be customized. Enabling Ext3 in the "
"<option>data=journal</option> mode offers maximum security (data integrity), "
"but can slow down the system because both metadata and data are journaled. A "
"relatively new approach is to use the <option>data=ordered</option> mode, "
"which ensures both data and metadata integrity, but uses journaling only for "
"metadata. The file system driver collects all data blocks that correspond to "
"one metadata update. These data blocks are written to disk before the "
"metadata is updated. As a result, consistency is achieved for metadata and "
"data without sacrificing performance. A third option to use is "
"<option>data=writeback</option>, which allows data to be written to the main "
"file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal. This "
"option is often considered the best in performance. It can, however, allow "
"old data to reappear in files after crash and recovery while internal file "
"system integrity is maintained. Ext3 uses the <option>data=ordered</option> "
"option as the default."
