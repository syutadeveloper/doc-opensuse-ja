While it can be argued that all systems should be set up to be as securely as possible, some levels of security and hardening may very well be overkill in some cases. Each system's operational environment has its own security requirements derived from business drivers or regulatory compliance mandates. &sls; can, for example, be configured to comply with security standards, such as SOX, HIPAA and PCIDSS. It can also be set up to fulfill the requirements from the German Federal Office of Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) as described in BSI TR-02102-1. An effective business requirements analysis should be performed to determine the right level of security and hardening to be applied to a server or defined as part of a baseline server build."

In this way, the trust relationship between the people that use the systems is transported across these systems. The chain that is formed by your trust relationships is only as strong as the weakest link. It is good practice to graphically visualize the trust relationships with the services in a schematic overview or map of your network. Generally, it is up to the owner of a resource to enforce the policies imposed on that resource; this would usually be the server that provides the resource. The client that opens a connection to request the resource can only be made responsible for the actions that it performs. This refers to the action of opening the connection to start with, but to nothing else as such."

Some tools help: Use sudo(8) for administrative tasks, but be aware that after the privilege boundary is crossed, a program running with root privileges does not enforce any file access policies for non-privileged users anymore. vi(1) that runs as root can read and write to any file in the system."

AIDE works by creating a database containing information about the files on your system. The database is created from rules laid out in the configuration file aide.conf.

Assuming a comparison check is being run, any changes not permitted by the configuration file are reported."
