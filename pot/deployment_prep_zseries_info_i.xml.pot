msgid "If you install &productname; for &zseries; into a logical partition (LPAR), assign memory and processors to the instance. Installing into LPAR is recommended for highly loaded production machines. Running in LPAR also makes higher security standards available. Networking between LPARs is possible over external interfaces or HiperSockets. In case you plan to use your installation for virtualization with KVM, installing into LPAR is highly recommended."

msgid "Running &productname; for &zseries; in z/VM means that &productname; is a guest system within z/VM. An advantage of this mode is that you have full control over &productname; from z/VM. This is very helpful for kernel development or kernel-based debugging. It is also very easy to add or remove hardware to and from Linux guests. Creating additional &productname; guests is simple and you can run hundreds of Linux instances simultaneously."
